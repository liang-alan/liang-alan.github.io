                    <p>Growing up, I was fascinated by video games. My childhood dream is to be able to create my own video game.
                        Though my passion for game development has not faltered, I slowly began to see the power
                        of computer science in so many different aspects of life. At its core, computer science is 
                        all about problem solving. I believe that the power of computer science can be used to
                        ameliorate many pressing issues today, such as climate change and environmental sustainability.
                        However, I also recognize the potential negative impacts of technology on us and our planet; thus, 
                        I am also passionate about exploring AI governance and ethics and how it can protect our humanity.

                    <p> During this 12 week internship, I delivered an project from design to production on the Classification
                        Policy Platform team. Using React and TypeScript, I migrated an external service to a centralized platform to
                        improve existing functions and add new features to reduce manual effort. This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding 
                        of the intricacies of the software development lifecycle.

                    <p> As a peer mentor for the class "Building User Interfaces",
                        I feel responsible and am eager to guide other student through their academic journey. As a peer mentor, I regularly
                        interact with several of the 100+ students in the class, assisting them in UI topics. At the same time,
                        I am able to gain a deeper understanding of React, React Native, and other fundamental concepts of front-end development.

                    <p> I spent the summer of 2023 promoting water safety around Milwaukee. I learned so much about effective community engagement.
                        The overall experience also allowed me to reflect on the socialeconomic disparities 
                        within society and how our identites shape our lives. Additionally, I was given the oppurtunity to
                        apply my computer science knowledge, as I developed the website for the project. The development of this site
                        enhanced my knowledge in WordPress, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap and the development of accessible websites.

                    <p> As my first official work experience, this job prepared me for the professional world.
                        I learned how to communicate with students, coworkers, and supervisors in a collaborative
                        environment. The Mathnasium way of teaching emphasized the importance of teamwork, which 
                        has stuck with me ever since. Going in to work being prepared for over 100 kids to come in 
                        the center everyday was not easy, but it taught me the importance of teamwork and communication.

                    <p>Academics can be stressful. That's why I always reserve time to relax. In the morning, you may find me
                        running along the beautiful Lake Mendota, as the sunrises above the capitol. After a long day of classes, you
                        can find me playing volleyball or pickleball with my friends and roaming the library for my next read</a>. 
                        Late at night, you may find me scribbling poetry in notebooks or playing the piano.
                        Wherever I am, I always look for ways to maintain balance between my mental health and my work.

                    <p> At UW-Madison, I am proud to be on the copresident for the Chinese American Student Association here.
                        I an focused on creating an uplifting and inclusive culture within the club. Being a executive board member has taught me about the importance of little details when planning.
                        It always a joy to surround myself with people who share the same culture as me. That's why I also am a part of the Education and Social Justice committee 
                        for the Asian American Pacific Islander Desi Heritage Month, where we focus on creating cultural events that can not only teach, but connect those within the APIDA community and beyond.

                        teaching children about the power of computer science. As a part of the Wisconsin Idea Fellowship "Cultivating Connections" project as well,
                        I also mentor nearby high school students about what it means to be Asian-American in an academic, career, and social setting. It brings me joy
                        to be able to connect with the youth and help them write their own stories.

                        goal of mine I have are to travel the world. Some of my most enjoyable memories were made when I studied abroad in Japan 
                        and I hope to experience even more cultures in the future. Aside from travelling,  I also hope
                        to develop a small video game, and publish a book.
