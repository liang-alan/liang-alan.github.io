                    <p>Growing up, I was fascinated by video games. It was always my dream to make my own game.
                        Though my passion for game development has not faltered, I slowly began to see the power
                        of computer science in so many different realms of life. At its core, computer science is 
                        all about problem solving, and I believe that the power of computer science can be used to
                        ameliorate many pressing issues today, such as climate change and environmental sustainability.
                        In the future, I hope to be able to use my skills to create a positive impact in the world.

                    <p> As my first official work experience, this job prepared me for the professional world.
                        I learned how to communicate with students, coworkers, and supervisors in a collaborative
                        environment. The Mathnasium way of teaching emphasized the importance of teamwork, which 
                        has stuck with me ever since.

                    <p> I spent the summer of 2023 promoting water safety around Milwaukee. I learned so much about effective community engagement.
                        The overall experience also allowed me to reflect on the socialeconomic disparities 
                        within society and how our identites shape our lives. Additionally, I was given the oppurtunity to
                        apply my computer science knowledge, as I developed the website for the project. The development of this site
                        enhanced my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and BootStrap and the development of accessible websites.

                    <p>School can be stressful. That's why I always reserve time to relax. After a long day of classes, you
                        can find me at the public library, roaming the shelves for my next read. Late at night, you may find me 
                        scribbling out poetry in my notebook. Over the weekends, you may find me trying new recipes or searching for
                        my next favorite restaunt with my friends. Over breaks and holidays, you'll find me at home, playing Canon in D on the piano. 
                        Wherever I am, I always look for ways to maintain my inner peace.

                        I am in charge of planning and executing events. It always a joy to surround myself with people who share
                        the same culture as me. I am also a part of UW-Madison Code To Connect club, where we focus on youth outreach,
                        teaching children about the power of computer science.

                        goals I have are to travel the world. Some of my most enjoyable memories were made when I studied abroad in Japan over the summer 
                        and I hope to experience even more cultures in the future. Aside from travelling,  I also hope
                        to develop a small video game, and publish a book.
