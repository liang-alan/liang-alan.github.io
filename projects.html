                    <h6>June 2024</h6>
                    <p>I made this mobile app using ReactNative. This is an upgraded version of EmptyFridge, which was a web app I made in my first hackathon. 
                        This app allows users to input the ingredients they have in their fridge and it will generate recipes for them using the spoonacular
                        API.

                    <p>I made this website completely from scratch as a test of the HTML and CSS skills I have learned. What would have been
                        an impossible task for me just a year ago, I am proud of this site! In the future, I hope to make it even better
                        by making the website more responsive.

                    <h6>Aug 2023 - June 2024</h6>
                    <p>This website was created as a part of my summer internship with the University of Wisconsin Sea Grant/Water Resources Institutes.
                        This website is accessible and allows all users to learn about the program, how to get involved, and how to stay safe around our
                        waters. Developing this website taught me enhanced my skills in HTML, CSS, JS, but also gave me experience in the development 
                        process of a responsive website. I had to meet with many different people to incorporate their feedback and ideas into the website, until
                        it was complete. The website was eventually moved to WordPress which allows for easier updating and maintenance.

                    <h6>November 2023</h6>
                    <p>This is a for fun website I made, which infuses my skills in computer science with my passion for music.
                        It is inspired by popular music games such as Piano Tiles and Guitar Hero.
                        This website is made entirely from scratch and the music within it is arranged by me. While there is currently only one song, I hope 
                        to add more songs in the future.

                    <h6>November 2023</h6>
                    <p>This project was made as a project for the 2023 Fall MadHacks competition. Over these 24hours, I applied my
                        HTML and CSS knowledge to create a website that helps users track their spending and budgeting, inspired by
                        other apps such as SplitWise. Through this, I learned to use MongoDB to store and retrieve data. Though this
                        project flipped my sleep schedule, I enjoyed deepening my knowledge in Computer Science.

                    <h2>Music Quizzer</h2>
                    <h6>May 2023</h6>
                    <p>This website is inspired by the Lyricle music trivia website. It was one of my favorite Wordle variations so when
                        the website was shut down, I was inspired to make my own version. I had little knowledge of CSS at the time so I was focused
                        on functionality, rather than design. I learned how to use APIs (Spotify) to access Spotify information and allow users to customize the game 
                        to their own Spotify playlists. Unfortunately, as Spotify prohibits the publishing of music trivia games, so this website is unavailable to
                        the public.

                    <p>
                        EmptyFridge is an innovative solution to tackle food waste. It allows users to find tasty recipes to use 
                        up leftover ingredients. This was my first Hackathon ever so I was nervous and a bit lost. I was able to
                        gather the data and parse it into a useable, JSON format. This project was also my first time doing web development.
                        I had never touched HTML, CSS, or JS before. This project was awarded the Best Sustainability Hack award by Avanade.
